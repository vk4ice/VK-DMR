# VK-DMR Codeplugs for Retevis RT84 & RT3S DMR hand-held radios.
RT384 and RT3S Codeplugs.
(I made this available to BARC members about a month ago...then 13
repeaters were added to the network so it had to be withdrawn just
as quickly)

Ok Guys,

Brave enough to have a crack at uploading a new codeplug?
Many new callsigns on the DMR ID database so it must be time to
include the new ones. I see 4RMC (Brisbane) and 4RQT (Toowoomba) are
back on the dashboard too.

I have set new zones for....
VHF Hotspot
UHF Hotspot
Duplex Hotspot
(Inside the hotspot zones have been setup for VK DMR and
Brandmeister).

This codeplug has zones for....
Every analogue 2m & 70cm repeater in VK in state based zones.
Marine (RX only)
UHF CB (RX only)
A local zone containing a number of SE Qld repeaters and associated
talk-groups to get you up and going quickly.
A Calibrate zone for calibrating your Pi-Star and minimising BER.
Satellites zone for chasing the birds. (use the side monitor button
to open the mute)
All RF DMR repeaters in VK

Other inclusions:

TG1910 (Links all ARNSW funded repeaters down south)
TG1911 (Links two ARNSW funded repeaters in Far North Qld)

Port Macquarie have announced they will be commissioning a repeater
for DMR (maybe co-sited with VK2RCN) I’m awaiting the final
frequency assignment. It is pretty much ready to go in the codeplug,
apart from the repeater’s frequencies.

Both, VHF and UHF DMR simplex frequencies are now in the Hotspot zones
for quick access (TG99 Time slot1). They are called Sim_VHF and
Sim_UHF  in the channel list (144.800MHz and 439.200MHz) I had a
long simplex chat with Paul (VK4FPPR )today on UHF Simplex, so it
does work well.

14 new DMR repeaters have been added to the network, so these needed
to be slid into position.

For the brave.....load this one and give it a try.
I downloaded the  BARC codeplug for the RT3S, added the newly added
talk-groups, added the DMR ID database (and added a hotspot zone for
VHF & duplex hotspots). You will need to add your own callsign and
DMR ID before you upload it to the radio.
It is actually a tidy little codeplug for use about South East
Queensland, with or without a hotspot. It has more than enough to
get started and is not difficult to navigate. BARC use 439.150MHz as
their Hotspot frequency. The “A” side of the radio is Digital, the
“B” side is analogue (in the hotspot zones). Most are using 439.125MHz

Anyhow, use it, break it.... See what additions it needs....
Let’s see if it can be tweaked to suit us all. Time for these
codeplugs to be released this into the wild for proper testing.

Shoot me an email if you would like changes, alterations and
additions. It's difficult keeping up with so much data, but if you would
like a new analogue repeater added, email vk4ice@gmail.com

Listen for me on VK DMR TG53

I use Cathy’s (G6AMU) Code Plug Editor (the secret sauce) for adding
the DMR ID database updates to quickly manipulate the data, add new
talk-groups. This in in the files section for you to download. I use the
standard RT3S (or RT84 if you use that model) software to upload to the radio.
I do regular updates to these files, so if you would like to be added to a RT84/RT3S
email list to be notified of updates, shoot me an email vk4ice@gmail.com

That’s enough for now....
Remember...if you don’t have a DMR radio.... DroidStar for Android
devices is available on the Playstore for your Android phone or tablets.

Best regards,

Dave - VK4ICE
